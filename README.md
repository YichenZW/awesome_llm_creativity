Scope: This paper focuses on generative models and tasks, mainly based on the text modality.


## Theory of Computational Creativity

Allen Newell, J. C. Shaw & Herbert A. Simon — The Processes of Creative Thinking (1958/59)

* This is an early work that treated creative thinking as a variant (or extension) of problem-solving and attempted to model it within an information-processing / computer-based framework.  ￼
* It asks: Is creative thinking just “ordinary” problem solving under different constraints, or is it something fundamentally different?


Margaret A. Boden — “Computer Models of Creativity” (1998 / 2009)

* Boden is a key figure in the theory of computational creativity. Her work provides a clear taxonomy and discussion of what “creativity” might mean in a computational context.

## Optimization

### Sampling and Search

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04197.pdf

[Note] For LLMs, we argue that sampling and search methods are mainly optimizing toward diversity, which is a different concept from creativity. Please refer to our awesome LLM diversity paperlist: https://github.com/YichenZW/awesome-llm-diversity.
